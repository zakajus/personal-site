The source for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/zakajus/personal-site). I threw it together in one evening using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) theme, but it's fast and low maintanence.

Fun fact: I took an elective in web development at university, with the dream of making this site far more impressive. This dream was then shatterred by the cost difference between hosting a dynamic vs static site (it's free).
