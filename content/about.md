I am currently studying computer science at Vilnius University. 

### Education
Going back a few years, I had the opportunity to go to middle-school at an international school in Berlin. This made me a lot more open-minded, introduced me to a wide range of cultures, and vastly improved my academic English skills. After 3 years in Germany, I returned to Lithuania and finished high-school by doing the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. 

### Interests
I produce electronic music under the moniker [Cheerleader](https://soundcloud.com/yourcheerleader) - this includes drum and bass, hyperpop, and a wide range of other genres.

I'm a huge proponent of (Arch) Linux and open-source software. In my beloved [dotfiles](https://github.com/zakajus/dotfiles) repo you can find my indefinite search for the perfect dev environment using NeoVim, TMUX, and a bunch of other tools.

As of December 2024, I am learning audio plugin development in C++ using the JUCE framework.
